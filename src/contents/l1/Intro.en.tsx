        <Strong>If you’re in the tech industry:</Strong> You might know that Y
        Combinator is a startup accelerator (choice 1). But{' '}

          did you know that Y Combinator (the startup accelerator) is actually

        <Strong>If you’re a programmer:</Strong> You might know that Y
        Combinator (in programming) is some kind of a functional programming

          can you explain what Y Combinator (in programming) is to a

      <Strong>Before we begin, here’s some backstory:</Strong> In 2005, a group
      of successful entrepreneurs started training (and investing in) young
      startup founders. This startup “accelerator” became known as “Y
      Combinator”.{' '}
      <ExternalLink href="http://www.ycombinator.com/press/">
        As of writing (Fall 2018)
      </ExternalLink>
      , Y Combinator has invested in roughly 2000 startups, and the total
      valuation of all Y Combinator companies is roughly{' '}
      <Em>$100 billion dollars</Em>. <Strong>Example:</Strong> Dropbox graduated
      from Y Combinator{' '}
      <ExternalLink href="https://www.ycombinator.com/apply/dropbox/">
        in 2017
      </ExternalLink>{' '}
      and became a public company in 2018.
    </P>
    <P>
      <Strong>Now, why did they name it “Y Combinator”?</Strong> Here's what{' '}
      <Em>Paul Graham</Em>, one of the founders of Y Combinator, said in{' '}
      <ExternalLink href="https://mixergy.com/interviews/y-combinator-paul-graham/">
        an interview

        <Strong>
          <Em>[Y Combinator is] a programming trick.</Em>
        </Strong>{' '}
        ... I wanted to call it Y Combinator just because I thought the Y
        Combinator was a really cool thing. So it would be the perfect name for{' '}
        <Em>picking out the kind of people that we wanted</Em>. Hackers would
        look at this and think, “That’s so cool. They’re named after the Y
        Combinator. There must be something going on here.” And suits would look
        at it and think, “Y Combinator, what’s that?” That was what we wanted.{' '}
        <Em>We wanted hackers to notice us, and suits, we didn’t care</Em>.
      </P>
    </Blockquote>
    <P>
      <Strong>Summary:</Strong> They wanted to invest in entrepreneurs who were
      good programmers (hackers) and <Em>avoid non-programmers</Em>. To attract
      programmers, they named it “Y Combinator”, after a cool programming trick.
    </P>
    <P>
      <Strong>But I don’t like this mindset.</Strong> I don’t like it when
      programmers say, <Em>“Oh, non-programmers won’t understand this idea”</Em>{' '}
      and refuse to explain it in a way non-programmers understand. I think this
      kind of a mindset is harmful, especially as the software (especially AI)
      is changing the world faster than ever.

      <Strong>
        Can non-programmers learn what Y Combinator (in programming) is?
      </Strong>{' '}
      The answer is <Em>Yes</Em>. I just made an interactive tutorial where
      anyone can learn what Y Combinator is. <Em>There’s no coding involved</Em>
      ; rather, you'll learn by <Em>solving puzzles</Em>.
